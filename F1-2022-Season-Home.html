				<h2>Formula 1 Background </h2>
					<p>Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).
					   The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950.
					   The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform.
					   A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.
				   	</p>




				<h2>2022 Season Description </h2>
					<p>The 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship is a planned motor racing championship for Formula One cars which will be the 73rd running of the Formula One World Championship.
						 It is recognised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the governing body of international motorsport, as the highest class of competition for open-wheel racing cars.
						 The championship is due to be contested over twenty-three Grands Prix, which will be held around the world, and it is scheduled to end earlier than in other recent years to avoid overlapping with the FIFA World Cup.
						  Drivers and teams are scheduled to compete for the titles of World Drivers' Champion and World Constructors' Champion respectively.
					</p>

					<p>The 2022 championship is expected to see the introduction of significant changes to the sport's technical regulations.
						These changes had been intended to be introduced in 2021, but were delayed until 2022 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
					</p>

					<p>Max Verstappen, driving for Red Bull Racing, is the reigning Drivers' Champion, whilst Mercedes are the reigning Constructors' Champions.
