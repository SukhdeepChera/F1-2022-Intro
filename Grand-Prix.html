					<p>  Ground was broken for the Bahrain International Circuit in December 2002. Like the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi,
                         the developers had a blank, sandy canvas to work with, and with that fashioned the technical, 5.4km track designed by Hermann Tilke.
                         You can usually expect great racing and decent amounts of overtaking in Bahrain, while the drivers have to contend with wind,
                         racing under floodlights and the difficulty of finding a decent set-up with the wide temperature fluctuations between sessions.
                         The track’s most challenging point is the tight, downhill, off-camber Turn 10 left-hander, while the fast run through Turn 12 is
                         another highlight, allowing the racers to really feel their cars coming alive. This year's race will be the first race of the season on the 20th of March.

					<p>The Jeddah Corniche Circuit is, you won’t be surprised to hear, a temporary street circuit (albeit adorned with some permanent sections),
                        located on the Corniche – a 30km coastal resort area of the ancient Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah.
                        Designed by the Tilke company, in conjunction with Formula 1’s own Motorsports team – who used Google Earth for their initial investigations into potential layouts
                        – F1’s Ross Brawn said of the track: “What we want to see is a race circuit. We don’t want Mickey Mouse circuits.
                        We don’t want those old classic street circuits with 90 degree turns. We want fast sweeping circuits, circuits which are going to challenge the drivers –
                        and they are going to love it.” This years race will be held on March 27th.

    			alt="Melbourne Circuit" title="Melbourne Circuit"/>
					<p> The deal to host Formula 1 in Melbourne was done in 1993, with the decision taken to create a circuit using a mixture of the existing roads around the city’s Albert Park
                        – mainly Aughtie Drive and Lakeside Drive if you fancy driving it yourself – with a little detour through the Lakeside Stadium’s car park.As a temporary facility,
                         Albert Park can be quite bumpy, while the circuit at the start of the weekend is often slippery, rubbering in as the sessions progress.
                         It’s also a circuit that requires a well-sorted chassis, with several spots on the track where the drivers require a reactive front end to allow
                         them to chuck it into a corner – the main one being the rapid Turn 11-12 chicane. Melbourne is also one of the faster tracks on the calendar,
                         with Lewis Hamilton’s 2019 pole lap set at an average of over 235km/h. The race will be held on the 10th of April.

                    <p>Imola – or the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari as it’s been known since 1988 –
                        had its foundation stone laid in March 1950. It was ready for testing by October 1952, while racing began at the circuit in 1953.A thrill ride.
                        After testing his AlphaTauri AT01 at the track in the build-up to the 2020 season, Pierre Gasly called the experience one of the
                        best he’d ever had in a Formula 1 car, while his then-team mate Daniil Kvyat remarked that “an F1 car through corners like Acque Minerali
                        – the entrance is so fast, it’s so cool. It really gives you a lot of adrenaline.”
                        The anti-clockwise circuit is certainly fast, with an old-school feel as the drivers put it on the line in iconic corners like the aforementioned Acque Minerali and Piratella.
                        The race will be held on the 24th of April.

                    <p> Making its F1 debut in May 2022, the Miami International Autodrome is a temporary circuit, but one designed to have a permanent feel.
                        Set in the Hard Rock Stadium complex in Miami Gardens, home to the NFL’s famous Miami Dolphins franchise, the track is the culmination
                        of a development process that simulated no less than 36 different layouts before settling on a thrilling, 19-turn lap that provides a street circuit vibe,
                        not dissimilar to Melbourne’s Albert Park. The inaugural Miami Grand Prix takes place in 2022, the Florida race joining its Texan counterpart in Austin to
                        become the second US race on the calendar – and the 11th different American venue to host a round of the Formula 1 world championship.
                        A street-track spectacular. With the Hard Rock Stadium at its epicentre, the 5.41km layout will feature 19 corners, three straights,
                        potential for three DRS zones, and an estimated top speed of 320km/h. There are elevation changes too, the main one found between
                        Turns 13 and 16, with the track heading over an exit ramp and under various flyovers across uneven ground. The Turn 14-15 chicane,
                        meanwhile, has an uphill approach, with a crest in the middle, and then drops down on exit. The race will be held on May 8th.

                    <p> The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya was built as part of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics development programme.
                        The foundation stone was laid in 1989, while the first car race was a round of the 1991 Spanish Touring Car Championship.
                        Two weeks after the touring cars raced at Barcelona, it was Formula 1’s turn. The track enjoyed a sensational debut,
                        with Nigel Mansell and Ayrton Senna’s famous eyeball-to-eyeball drag race down the straight, before Mansell took the lead and drove on to victory.
                        The drivers love the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, which is just as well, because they spend huge amounts of time pounding around it during winter testing.
                        The track is a good mix of high- and low-speed corners, with the challenging Turn 3 right-hander a great chance to evaluate the balance of the car your
                        team’s designers have given you to fight with for the season. The race will be held on May 22nd.

                    <p>It was 1929 when racing engines first reverberated around the Principality, after cigarette manufacturer Antony Noghes decided to organise a race with his pals from the Automobile Club de Monaco.
						 The race was part of the calendar in the first year of the Formula 1 World Championship in 1950, and hasn’t been off it since 1955.Incredibly narrow and totally iconic.
						 Nelson Piquet memorably described driving around Monaco as “like riding a bicycle around your living room”… which is fair.
						 Despite that, it’s a challenge that nearly all drivers love, forcing them to put their skills on the line and rewarding millimetric accuracy.
						 Overtaking on the tight streets is harder, however, with the 2003 Grand Prix witnessing a grand total of zero passing moves! The Race will be held on May 29th.

                    <p> The first Grand Prix in Baku was held in 2016, as the European Grand Prix. That was followed by the inaugural Azerbaijan Grand Prix in 2017, which witnessed one of the biggest
						upsets of the season, with Daniel Ricciardo winning out from Valtteri Bottas and the Williams of Lance Stroll, while Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian
						Vettel engaged in some argy-bargy behind the Safety Car. A mixture of wide and open and tight and twisty. The lonnnnng main straight along the Baku shoreline is a
						slipstreaming mecca, and with cars able to run three abreast into Turn 1, the action often looks more IndyCar than F1.
						However from there, the track loops around into the city’s narrow, winding Icheri Sheher old town, dramatically wending past Baku’s medieval city walls.
						As in Monaco, slightest mistakes are punished quickly and severely, while set-up wise, the teams are forced to choose between downforce for the twisty bits and less drag for the straight.
						The race will be held on Jun 12th.

                    <p> The man-made Notre Dame Island in the middle of the St Lawrence River was created for the 1967 Expo 67 World's Fair. Once the expo and the ensuing 1976 Montreal
						Summer Olympics had left town, some clever people decided to make a race track out of the island’s roads. And lo, the Circuit Ile Notre-Dame, as it then was, came to be.
						With the Canadian Grand Prix having been in search of a permanent home for a number of years in the 1960s and 1970s,
						the Circuit Ile Notre-Dame first hosted the race in 1978. Fittingly, Gilles Villeneuve claimed his maiden win, at the track that would end up bearing his name.
						The fast, low-downforce circuit is one of the drivers’ favourites. The track is quite stop-start, with lots of heavy-braking chicanes and the
						famous hairpin to get the anchors working hard. Out of the corners, though, the track is quick and flowing, while the most iconic piece of the
						circuit comes right at the end of the lap: the Wall of Champions, so-called after excursions into it from Damon Hill, Jacques Villeneuve and Michael
						Schumacher during the 1999 Canadian Grand Prix weekend. The race will be held on Jun 19th.

						the world’s greatest race tracks. But, well, they were! The Silverstone circuit was first used for a proper motor race in 1947 –
						although sadly, a local sheep lost its life during the proceedings. Silverstone was the first Grand Prix, hosting the inaugural
						Formula 1 World Championship round on May 13 1950. Old campaigner Giuseppe Farina, who’d take that year’s title, won the race in his Alfa Romeo 158.
						At the 2018 British Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton compared a flat-out lap around Silverstone to flying a fighter jet,
						which should tell you all you need to know about the Northamptonshire circuit. Despite numerous layout changes over the years, Silverstone
						has always maintained its essential character as one of the fastest tracks on the F1 calendar, while historic corners like Maggotts, Becketts
						and Abbey provide some of the biggest challenges for racing drivers anywhere in the world. The race will be held on July 3rd.

                    <p> The fearsome, original Osterreichring was originated in 1969 as a replacement for the Zeltweg airfield circuit.
						The track known today as the Red Bull Ring was more or less created over the winter of 1995-6, when Hermann Tilke was
						engaged to turn the Osterreichring into a shorter, more modern race track. The A1-Ring, as it was then called, was opened in 1996, with Formula 1
						arriving at the circuit a year later. Jacques Villeneuve won the race, while Jean Alesi had a spectacular crash when his Benetton climbed up the
						Ferrari of Eddie Irvine. Alesi’s team mate Gerhard Berger, meanwhile, used his home Grand Prix to announce his F1 retirement.
						It’s only wee, bless it, but the Red Bull Ring packs a lot into a short lap. The first half rewards power, as the cars blast along three
						straights separated by a pair of uphill right-handers. But then as the drivers work their way downhill, the circuit becomes a regular toboggan
						ride, as the cars canyon through a series of quick corners, including the exhilarating Rindt right-hander, named for Austria’s first F1 champion.
						The race will be held on July 10th.

						The year was 1986. Nelson Piquet won the first F1 race around the Hungaroring, famously slithering his Williams around the outside of Ayrton Senna’s Lotus to take the lead.
						The lack of straights at the Hungaroring often sees it compared to a karting circuit – and it’s true, the resemblance is uncanny. With several series of corners to
						string together, teams opt for Monaco levels of downforce, with a well-sorted chassis tending to be rewarded over horsepower given the short straights on offer.
						It’s a challenge many of the drivers relish, however, with finding a good rhythm key to setting fast lap times. The race will be held on July 31st.

                    <p> The original, triangle-shaped track was built in 1921, with designers Jules de Thier and Henri Langlois van Ophem using public roads between the towns of
						Francorchamps, Malmedy, and Stavelot to create an amazing 14.9km circuit taking in the forests and rolling hills of the beautiful Ardennes region.
						The track was redeveloped in 1979, and although the new circuit is only half the original's length, it’s still the longest on the current calendar at 7.004km.
						Having hosted a non-championship Grand Prix as long ago as 1924, Belgium’s iconic circuit was one of just seven to be part of Formula 1’s maiden championship in 1950.
						That race was won by the legendary Juan Manuel Fangio, who led home an Alfa Romeo one-two ahead of team mate Nino Farina. Spa is among Formula 1 drivers’
						most loved tracks, with its mix of long straights and challenging fast corners allowing them to push their cars to the edge of their capabilities – if it’s dry,
						that is. The size of the track and the nature of Belgian weather means it can sometimes be raining on one part of the track and dry on another, meaning grip can vary
						from one corner to the next. Keep an eye on the thrilling Eau Rouge, arguably the most famous sequence of corners in the world, as the drivers flick left, right
						and then up the hill through Raidillon. The race will be held on August 28th.

                alt="Circuit Zandvoort" title="Circuit Zandvoort"/>
                    <p> Like Silverstone, Zandvoort was first opened in 1948, part of the wave of post-war motorsport enthusiasm that swept across Europe. Originally made up of a mixture of
						permanent track and public roads that snaked through the sand dunes of the Zandvoort resort town, the Dutch Automobile Racing Club – who initiated the
						plans for the circuit – brought in 1927 Le Mans winner Sammy Davis to consult on the layout for the original 4.2km track. Formula 1 arrived in the Dutch dunes in 1952,
						with Alberto Ascari dominating the race as he led home a 1-2-3 for Ferrari. Formula 1 would go on to race on and off at the track until 1985 – before, in 2019, the
						announcement came that the championship would return to Zandvoort for 2020, after a 35-year hiatus. The Covid-19 pandemic meant that became 36 years and a 2021 date.
						‘Really quick’, ‘pretty insane’, ‘crazy’ and ‘old-school’ were words used by the current crop of F1 drivers when asked to describe the Zandvoort track
						that many of them tackled in their junior category days. We’d also add ‘undulating’ to that list. The Zandvoort track swoops and flows through the sand dunes,
						creating a rollercoaster-like feel to the lap. And while the circuit was modernised in time for F1’s most recent return – including increasing the banking angle at
						the famous Tarzan corner to an Indianapolis Motor Speedway-trumping 18 degrees – Zandvoort remains a proper, challenging drivers’ track. The race will be held on September 4th.

                    <p> Constructed in just 110 days in 1922, the Autodromo Nazionale Monza was the world’s third purpose-built race track, coming after Brooklands in the UK and Indianapolis
						in the US. Like those two tracks, the original circuit featured a daunting series of banked curves, as well as much of the ‘outfield’ section that’s still in use today.
						Monza opened its doors on September 3 1922, just a week before it hosted that year’s Italian Grand Prix. It was then part of the original Formula 1 calendar
						in 1950, and has held the Italian Grand Prix every year bar one since. Rapido! Formula 1’s fastest ever lap was set at Monza – Williams driver Juan Pablo
						Montoya’s 260.6km/h effort during practice for the 2004 Grand Prix – which should give you some idea of the nature of the track the locals call ‘La Pista Magica’.
						Cars are on full throttle for 80% of the lap, and hit their Vmax on the circuit’s 1.1km start/finish straight. From there, they roar off into the historic park section,
						where a series of big stops into tight chicanes give the brakes a good workout. The race will be held on September 11th.

						Formula 1’s first ever Russian Grand Prix took place on October 12 2014. The race was won by Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton,
						who was midway through a five-race winning streak that would ultimately see him clinch that year’s drivers’ title. Looking at a map of the track, your eye can’t help but be
						drawn to the epic Turn 3, a 750m constant-radius left-hander taking the drivers around the outside of the dramatic Poyushchiye fountain.
						The rest of the track is characterised by a series of 90-degree bends coupled to some rapid, flowing straights-that-aren’t-straight. The race will be held on September 25th.

						the initial circuit plan by Herman Tilke was refined by KBR Inc, while the event has quickly established itself as one of the standouts on the F1 calendar.
						In 2008, Singapore had the honour of hosting the first night-time race in F1 history. The Grand Prix – the 15th round of that season –
						proved a huge hit with the teams and drivers, while Renault’s Fernando Alonso claimed a controversial victory.
						The 5.063km Marina Bay Circuit is one of the most physically demanding on the calendar, its bumpy street surface coupled with humid conditions
						giving the drivers plenty to think about. With 23 corners, they are working the wheel a lot, too, around the high-speed lap – the physical stress
						causing them to lose as much as 3kg over the course of a race. The circuit also boasts some of the most unique features of any track on the F1 calendar,
						including Turn 18, which actually sees the drivers pass underneath a grandstand. The race will be held on October 2nd.

                    <p> In 1962. Soichiro Honda, whose car company you may have heard of, was a man with big ambitions. Seeking to turn Honda into an automotive powerhouse,
						he decided his company should have its own test track. Dutchman John Hugenholtz got the nod, and drew up the now-iconic ‘crossover’ Suzuka track –
						although original drawings saw the track pass over and under itself a full three times, which would have been sweet! Despite most people agreeing that Suzuka is a
						worthy successor to sliced bread in the ‘Best Thing’ stakes, the Japanese track was a relative latecomer to the F1 calendar, making its first appearance in 1987.
						Nigel Mansell would remember that weekend well, after he suffered a crash in qualifying that ruled him out of the race, gifting that year’s championship to his bitter rival Nelson Piquet.
						Show us a racing a driver who doesn’t love Suzuka, and we’ll show you a liar. The high-speed track remains one of the ultimate driving challenges, with the snaking ‘S’ Curves, the two
						commitment-rewarding Degners and the white-knuckle ride of 130R all highlights in a series of highlights at what is one of F1’s seminal tracks.
						And hey, it’s got a crossover, which is always cool, right? The race will be held on October 9th.

                    <p> The Circuit of The Americas, designed by Hermann Tilke in collaboration with American architectural firm HKS, endured something of a nervy start,
						with construction suffering several setbacks. It was well worth the wait, though, when 1978 F1 champion Mario andretti opened the track on October 21 2012.
						F1 first raced at the Circuit of The Americas in 2012, for the first United States Grand Prix since the 2007 race at Indianapolis.
						Unsurprisingly, over 100,000 spectators packed out the Austin venue, witnessing Lewis Hamilton’s last ever win in a McLaren before his switch to Mercedes for 2013.
						If the corners at COTA seem familiar, they should be. Turns 3 through 6 look not dissimilar to Silverstone's high-speed run through Maggotts/Becketts or the S
						Curves at Suzuka, while Turns 12 through 15 mimic Hockenheim's stadium section. Meanwhile, the uphill run into wide, wide Turn 1 –
						hey, everything’s bigger in Texas, right? – has provided some fine overtaking action in the track’s short life. The race will be held on October 23rd.

                    <p> In 1959. The father of Mexico’s most famous racing brothers, Ricardo and Pedro Rodriguez, was an advisor to Mexican President Adolfo Lopez Mateo,
						and had a word in his boss’s ear about building a racing circuit in Mexico City’s Magdalena Mixiuhca sports park using the existing internal roads.
						El Presidente liked the idea, and work on the track was completed in under a year. Formula 1 cars arrived in 1962 for a non-championship race,
						returning the following year for a proper, bona fide Grand Prix. That 1963 race was won by Jim Clark, while for the next few years,
						Mexico’s fiesta vibes meant it became the traditional season-ender for Formula 1. Mexico was welcomed back onto the F1 calendar in 2015.
						High up! The Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez sits over 2km above sea level, making the 4.3km lap a breathless experience. The track still largely
						follows the outline of the original 1959 circuit, the main difference being that the spectacular – and spectacularly scary –
						Peralta corner is now bisected, with the circuit instead winding through the old Foro Sol baseball stadium, providing one F1’s most unique vistas.
						The race will be held on October 30th.

						all the way back in 1938. The track designers took their inspiration from three main circuits: Brooklands in the UK, Roosevelt Raceway in the USA and Montlhery in France.
						Buoyed by the success of Brazil’s Emerson Fittipaldi, Formula 1 first jetted into Interlagos for a world championship race in 1973.
						Fans were treated to a home win in the first three Brazilian Grands Prix, with Fittipaldi victorious in 1973 and 1974, while Carlos Pace won in 1975.
						Like many pre-World War II tracks, Interlagos features banked corners, with the drivers beginning their lap on a sort of half oval – in fact, between 1957 and the track’s
						return to the F1 calendar in 1990, Interlagos could be run as a giant oval. After wiggling through the Senna S and down to Turn 4, the drivers then go through a
						snaking in-field section with some challenging camber changes, before slinging back up the hill and through the banked final turn. The race will be held on November 13th.

                    <p> In 2006, plans were announced to develop Yas Island, located just to the east of Abu Dhabi, into a new tourist destination, with a major part of the plans centring around a 5.5km race track.
						The diggers rolled into what would become the Yas Marina Circuit in May 2007, with the project completed by October 2009. In 2009. The track debuted as that year’s Formula 1 season finale,
						with Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel winning from team mate Mark Webber and the already-crowned 2009 champion Jenson Button. Vettel would go on to secure his first title in Abu Dhabi a
						year later, amid much crying. The Hermann Tilke-designed track is dominated by its 1.2km straight between Turns 5 and 6 – which, with slow-speed corners marking its
						beginning and end, makes it a honeypot for overtaking moves. Other highlights include the tricky run through Turns 10 and 11 into 12, which forces the drivers to
						brake hard with bags of lateral load still on the car. Track modifications ahead of the 2021 race, shortening the lap slightly to 5.28km, have only added to its excitement.
						The race will be held on November 20th.
